We curate eye-catching content pieces such as walkarounds, talk shows, event sneak-peeks and much more. We aim to showcase our work using social media as our primary outlet. However, our content is available for anyone on campus to view on screens spread across the same. We seek to celebrate every event taking place at the university by giving every single human at PESU a sense of being a part of it! So, the next time you see a bunch of folks walking around campus with mics and cameras, you know that\'s us! '],
